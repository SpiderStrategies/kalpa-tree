The code in this directory is pulled in from d3 3.5.17.

Upgrading to d3 v4 and its new hierarchy node object
appears to change way too much with how our tree works. So we
decided to punt upgrading the tree layout code for now.

The code was copied and pasted from files here: https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/v3.5.17/src/

With a minor change, so they can be required (i.e. `module.exports` additions)
